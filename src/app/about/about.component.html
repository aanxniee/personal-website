        <div class="about-bio">
            Nice to meet you! My name is Annie (she/her) and I'm a first year Systems Design Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
        
            <br>I'm interested in the intersection between design and technology and through my passion, I hope to create a more inclusive digital world. I am goal-oriented and I never pass an opportunity to try new things. I would love the chance to explore front-end development and UI/UX.<br>
        
            <br>In my free time, I enjoy visiting aesthetic cafes, skateboarding, hitting the gym, and binge-watching anime.<br>
        
            <br>Iâ€™m also currently exploring Fall 2023 internship opportunities.
